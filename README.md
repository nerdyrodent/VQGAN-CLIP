## Set up

This example uses [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) to manage virtual Python environments.

Create a new virtual Python environment for VQGAN-CLIP:

```sh
conda create --name vqgan python=3.9
conda activate vqgan
```

Install Pytorch in the new enviroment:

Note: This installs the CUDA version of Pytorch, if you want to use an AMD graphics card, read the [AMD section below](#using-an-amd-graphics-card).

```sh
pip install torch==1.9.0+cu111 torchvision==0.10.0+cu111 torchaudio==0.9.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

Install other required Python packages:

```sh
pip install ftfy regex tqdm omegaconf pytorch-lightning IPython kornia imageio imageio-ffmpeg einops torch_optimizer setuptools==59.5.0
```

Or use the ```requirements.txt``` file, which includes version numbers.

Clone required repositories:

```sh
git clone 'https://github.com/nerdyrodent/VQGAN-CLIP'
cd VQGAN-CLIP
git clone 'https://github.com/openai/CLIP'
git clone 'https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers'
```

Note: In my development environment both CLIP and taming-transformers are present in the local directory, and so aren't present in the `requirements.txt` or `vqgan.yml` files.

As an alternative, you can also pip install taming-transformers and CLIP.

You will also need at least 1 VQGAN pretrained model. E.g.

```sh
mkdir checkpoints

curl -L -o checkpoints/vqgan_imagenet_f16_16384.yaml -C - 'https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/d/a7530b09fed84f80a887/files/?p=%2Fconfigs%2Fmodel.yaml&dl=1' #ImageNet 16384
curl -L -o checkpoints/vqgan_imagenet_f16_16384.ckpt -C - 'https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/d/a7530b09fed84f80a887/files/?p=%2Fckpts%2Flast.ckpt&dl=1' #ImageNet 16384
```
Note that users of ```curl``` on Microsoft Windows should use double quotes.

The `download_models.sh` script is an optional way to download a number of models. By default, it will download just 1 model.

See <https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers#overview-of-pretrained-models> for more information about VQGAN pre-trained models, including download links.

By default, the model .yaml and .ckpt files are expected in the `checkpoints` directory.
See <https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers> for more information on datasets and models.

### Using an AMD graphics card

Note: This hasn't been tested yet.

ROCm can be used for AMD graphics cards instead of CUDA. You can check if your card is supported here:
<https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm#supported-gpus>

Install ROCm accordng to the instructions and don't forget to add the user to the video group:
<https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html>

The usage and set up instructions above are the same, except for the line where you install Pytorch.
Instead of `pip install torch==1.9.0+cu111 ...`, use the one or two lines which are displayed here (select Pip -> Python-> ROCm):
<https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>

### Using the CPU

If no graphics card can be found, the CPU is automatically used and a warning displayed.

Regardless of an available graphics card, the CPU can also be used by adding this command line argument: `-cd cpu`

This works with the CUDA version of Pytorch, even without CUDA drivers installed, but doesn't seem to work with ROCm as of now.

### Uninstalling

Remove the Python enviroment:

```sh
conda remove --name vqgan --all
```

and delete the `VQGAN-CLIP` directory.

## Run

To generate images from text, specify your text prompt as shown in the example below:

```sh
python generate.py -p "A painting of an apple in a fruit bowl"
```

<img src="./samples/A_painting_of_an_apple_in_a_fruitbowl.png" width="256px"></img>

## Multiple prompts

Text and image prompts can be split using the pipe symbol in order to allow multiple prompts.
You can also use a colon followed by a number to set a weight for that prompt. For example:

```sh
python generate.py -p "A painting of an apple in a fruit bowl | psychedelic | surreal:0.5 | weird:0.25"
```

<img src="./samples/Apple_weird.png" width="256px"></img>

Image prompts can be split in the same way. For example:

```sh
python generate.py -p "A picture of a bedroom with a portrait of Van Gogh" -ip "samples/VanGogh.jpg | samples/Bedroom.png"
```

### Story mode

Sets of text prompts can be created using the caret symbol, in order to generate a sort of story mode. For example:

```sh
python generate.py -p "A painting of a sunflower|photo:-1 ^ a painting of a rose ^ a painting of a tulip ^ a painting of a daisy flower ^ a photograph of daffodil" -cpe 1500 -zvid -i 6000 -zse 10 -vl 20 -zsc 1.005 -opt Adagrad -lr 0.15 -se 6000
```


## "Style Transfer"

An input image with style text and a low number of iterations can be used create a sort of "style transfer" effect. For example:

```sh
python generate.py -p "A painting in the style of Picasso" -ii samples/VanGogh.jpg -i 80 -se 10 -opt AdamW -lr 0.25
```

| Output                                                        | Style       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| <img src="./samples/vvg_picasso.png" width="256px"></img>     | Picasso     |
| <img src="./samples/vvg_sketch.png" width="256px"></img>      | Sketch      |
| <img src="./samples/vvg_psychedelic.png" width="256px"></img> | Psychedelic |

A video style transfer effect can be achived by specifying a directory of video frames in `video_style_dir`. Output will be saved in the steps directory, using the original video frame filenames. You can also use this as a sort of "batch mode" if you have a directory of images you want to apply a style to. This can also be combined with Story Mode if you don't wish to apply the same style to every images, but instead roll through a list of styles.


## Timeline

The Timeline tool can be used to create videos where the prompt and othere settings change through out the duration of the video.

```sh
python generate.py -tf "samples/timeline/sun.txt"
```

<img src="./samples/timeline/timeline.gif" width="256px"></img>

```py
# [sun.txt] Example of a Timeline file. (This line is not needed for the actual file.)
prompt="Blue", frames=1, iterations=25,
prompt="Painting of a One Sun in the Sky", frames=30, iterations=20,
prompt="Painting of the Sun setting over a mountain", frames=40, iterations=10, zoom=1.03,
prompt="Painting of Stars in the sky at night", frames=15, iterations=4, zoom=0.95,
prompt="Painting of Stars in the sky at night", frames=30, iterations=20, zoom=0.97,
prompt="Painting of driving down a road at night", frames=40, iterations=20, zoom=1.05,
```

### Timeline Keywords
```
Timeline Keywords:

  prompt=(String)
    Change the prompt.
    Default value: "Blue Duck"

  frames=(int)
    Number of frames for each line.
    Default value: 10

  iterations=(int)
    The number of iterations of training for each frame. (Lowering the number of iterations when changing prompts can add a more visible transition.)
    Default value: 10

  zoom=(float)
    How much to zoom per frame. =1 dont zoom, >1 zoom in, <1 zoom out.
    Default value: 1.0

  xshift=(int) / yshift=(int)
    How much to shift the image per frame in the X (left/right) or Y (up/down). Amount in pixels.
    Default value: 0

  # at the start of a line comments it out.

```

### Timeline Tutorial/Rules

When a setting is changed that setting continues for each line (Including blank line) until it is either changed back to the prevouis or changed to a new value.

Example:
```py
prompt="blue", zoom=1.1, frames=5
zoom=0.9, 
prompt="red", zoom=1.1, 
zoom=0.9, 

prompt="green", zoom=1, frames=10
```
1. In the first line, the `prompt`, `zoom` and `frames` are given a value.
Since `Iterations` and `xshift/yshift` are not set to any value, they are their default values.
Since `frames` is set to `5` each line will creat 5 frames. After 5 frames the next line will run.
 
2. The second line will also create 5 frames. The only change will be the `zoom` value. All the other settings will stay the same. The `prompt` is still `blue` and the number of `frames` is still `5`.
 
3. On the third line the `prompt` is changed to `red` and the `zoom` is adjusted again. Since the number of `frames` has not been changed it continues with creating 5 frames for this line.
 
4. Similarly to line 2, the only change is the `zoom`. But unlike line 2, the `prompt` is `red` since `red` was the last value that `prompt` was set to.
 
5. The fith line is blank. Since it changes no settings it runs exactly like line 4 did.
 
6. The sixth line changes `prompt`, `zoom` and `frames`. The `zoom` effect stops since it was set to `1`. The `prompt` is changed to `green`. And finally since the `frames` have been set to `10`, unlike the previous lines, line 6 creates 10 frames.
 
* Once all lines have been run the program then takes the images that have been created and saved to the `steps` file and turns them into a video.
 
Most all the arguments for `generate.py` work while using the Timeline tool. The only arguments that don't work are those that have an equivalent setting in the Timeline tool.

## Feedback example

By feeding back the generated images and making slight changes, some interesting effects can be created.

The example `zoom.sh` shows this by applying a zoom and rotate to generated images, before feeding them back in again.
To use `zoom.sh`, specifying a text prompt, output filename and number of frames. E.g.

```sh
./zoom.sh "A painting of a red telephone box spinning through a time vortex" Telephone.png 150
```
If you don't have ImageMagick installed, you can install it with ```sudo apt install imagemagick```

<img src="./samples/zoom.gif" width="256px"></img>

There is also a simple zoom video creation option available. For example:
```sh
python generate.py -p "The inside of a sphere" -zvid -i 4500 -zse 20 -vl 10 -zsc 0.97 -opt Adagrad -lr 0.15 -se 4500
```

## Random text example

Use `random.sh` to make a batch of images from random text. Edit the text and number of generated images to your taste!

```sh
./random.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### CUSOLVER_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR

For example:

`RuntimeError: cusolver error: CUSOLVER_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR, when calling cusolverDnCreate(handle)`

Make sure you have specified the correct size for the image.

### RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory

For example:

`RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 150.00 MiB (GPU 0; 23.70 GiB total capacity; 21.31 GiB already allocated; 78.56 MiB free; 21.70 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch)`

Your request doesn't fit into your GPU's VRAM. Reduce the image size and/or number of cuts.
